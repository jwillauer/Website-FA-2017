			<h2>Assignment 1 Narrative</h2>
			<span class="body">This week’s assignment had two main parts to it 1) construct a website to track our progress 
			of the final project and commit it to the Fab Academy Repository 2) Start initial work on our semester final project.
			<p></p> 
Part 1: Create personal web page and use the repository (GIT) The creation of this website is my ongoing attempt at learning HTML coding. 
While I have had enough training in the past to be dangerous there was a definite learning curve to these first two assignments. 
I chose to copy and modify a template from Templated. Both the HTML and GIT introduction parallel one of my hobbies very closely – snowboarding.
 While learning to snowboard you have to learn basic skills before you can progress on to more difficult ones. Once you believe that
 you have these skills learned gravity sends you a quick and often painful reminder that you still have a way to go. While there is no physical pain 
 involved with HTML and GIT once you think you have an idea that you are progressing things tend to go wrong very quickly. The only way to get proficient 
 is to practice. 	
 <p></p> 
 
Part 2:Final Project Idea:
Problem: I am an avid winter sports enthusiast, tinkerer, and information sponge. When I pick up a new hobby I like to learn all I can about the equipment including maintenance and repair. One of my main winter sports hobbies is snowboarding. With all the fun and rush of adrenaline that comes with making turns there is an abundant amount of upkeep with your snowboard equipment. “Tuning” is required on a regular basis, especially in the Mid-West where temperature change and conditions are not always optimal. Wax is one of the key ingredients to making sure your day at your local ski resort is an enjoyable one. Unfortunately I have more than one occasion where my wax has not fit the conditions due a drastic change in temperature. Temperature is a very important factor when it comes to wax, glide and speed on a ski run. Waxing can be a time intensive process with the potential for waste and damage to your snowboard. 
Goal: The hot box method is essentially putting your board in an oven for an extended period of time while controlling the temperature. While there are a few designs already on the market they are geared toward professional shops and cost thousands of dollars which put them out of reach for the average person who enjoys maintaining their own equipment.
I would like to:
-automate the process as much as possible
-reduce the amount of material waste
-reduce the “hands on” time it takes to wax
-increase the quality of the wax application to the snowboard base. 
-control the temperature accurately
-use minimal energy to complete the wax
-Use lightweight materials 
-decrease the cost of the overall project to make it more accessible to the average person.
