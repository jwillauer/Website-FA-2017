  <h2>Assignment 17</h2>
  <p class="body"> For week 17 we were asked to start looking at our final project more closely and propose our final project that combines a range of units covered. We were also asked to start looking at the following questions as well:
  <div></div>
    <h1>What will it do?</h1>
  <p>The main purpose of the Snowboard Hot Box will be to save active time waxing a snowboard. Currently the standard method for applying wax to a snowboard is to drip wax onto a snowboard base using a waxing iron. Once wax has been applied a technician/hobbyist then needs to spend time carefully smoothing and heating up the base of the snowboard evenly to heat up the wax/base and let the liquid wax absorb into the board. There are many downsides to this method including vast amounts of time and the chance that you can melt the snowboard base itself. Using a hotbox helps prevent this by keeping the temp in the box at a consistant temperature and allowing the person to walk away from the box. There is also some initial research that one hot box treatment is more efficient as it equal up to 10 hand iron waxing applications. If this box works it will save time by allowing me to work on other tasks while the board is in the box. I am also setting this up to accomdate up to three boards at one time.</p>
    <div></div>
<h1>Who has done what beforehand</h1>
  <p>There are some commercial companies that sell these types of boxes to businesses but the price range for these commercial boxes are thousands of dollars which puts them out of the range of most home do it yourself types of snowboard users.</p>
    <div></div>
<h1>What Materials and Components will be required</h1>
  <p>I plan on using corrogated cardboard laminated in multiple layers (like plywood) to construct the box itself. I think this will add to the insulating properties as there will be pockets of air trapped in between the layers. I will also be making the rack out of plywood, using foil backed insulation and some sort of air flow sealing to help make the box air tight. Other components of the system will be a method to start/stop the heating element, a secondary temp sensor and an on/off switch for the entire box. Lastly I would like to work on an interface that both reads out the box temp and potentially sends it to a personal device via blutetooh or wireless radio. Due to time the communication to a personal device will be the last thing I will work on if I have time.</p>
    <div></div>
<h1>Where will they come from?</h1>
  <p>The main box will be built from cardboard recyclyed/upcycled from our local area. A majority of the cardboard came from computer monitor boxes left over from the updating of my computer lab. I will used these to make the layers of the sides, top, bottom of and ends of the box. For items that can fit in the laser as one piece I will glue up the cardboard first. For the larger parts I will laser cut then glue them in layers. The components to house the electronics and heating element will be designed in Inventor and printed. The racks will come from 3/4 plywood sourced in our lab. Electronic parts will be sourced from our lab or purchased via the internet and any other components will be purchased from a large home improvement store in the area. Below I am including a complete bill ov materials showing where all parts were sourced and their price.</p>
    <div></div>
<h1>How much will it cost?</h1>
  <p>I would like to keep the cost of this less than 200.00 if possible</p>
    <div></div>
<h1>What parts and systems will be made?</h1>
  <p>I will be making the box, component housings, racks, and any electronics I can.</p>
    <div></div>
<h1>What processes will be used?</h1>
  <p>I will be encorporating 2D/3D design, CNC milling, CNC routing, 3D printing, Electronics production, Input, Output and System integration into this project</p>
    <div></div>
<h1>What tasks need to be completed?</h1>
  <li>Complete construction of box<br>
    Insulate the box<br>
    Design housings for electronics<br>
    Print the housings<br>
    Design rack and CNC mill them<br>
    Write code for temp sensor<br>
    Write code for LCD screen<br>
    Integrate in temp controller<br>
    Wire up components<br>
    Test box<br></li>
    <div></div>
<h1>What questions need to be answered?</h1>
  <li>What am I forgetting?<br>
    What boards do I need to fabricate?<br>
    How do I mix the code for temp sensor and LCD<br>
    Can I get the wireless done?<br></li>
    <div></div>
<h1>What is the schedule?</h1>
  <li>Complete the construction of box by June 1st<br>
    Complete printing of parts by June 5th<br>
    Complete electronics wiring and design by June 15th<br>
    Prepare for final presentation<br></li>
    <div></div>
<h1>How will it be evaluated?</h1>
  <p>The main evaluation for this project is whether or not it can maintain a temp range between 135 degrees Farenheit and 150 egrees Farenheit for a period of 8-9 hours. I would like the system to be able to use a 5 degree difference to even out the heating process. I would also like to be able to monitor the box's actual temp acurately.</p>
