	    <p class="body"> The Assignment for week 18 was develop a plan for dissemination of your final project, &nbsp;prepare a summary slide and video clip highlighting your final project. This was so that we could start to put our finishing touches on our Fab Academy projects and look at how we would protect our intellectual property. </p>

	    <p>The idea of a snowboarding hot box is not new. There are currently a couple of corporate manufacturers that are producing them for the ski and snowboard industry. These units are quite expensive and are being sold to commercial shops. I have located a couple of home enthusiasts that have some basic information on the idea of a hot box. My take on this product was to come at it from the easy to build with easy to locate parts that worked with little effort from the home hobbyist. I am also trying to keep it low cost, easy to move and easy to use. The main thought was to build a device to save me time as I am a person with many irons in the fire and spending 2-3 hours waxing board takes away from other activities. The skills learned in this course have helped me to build the first iteration of the homebuilt hot box which I hope will lead to refinement and maybe the licensing of plans for others to build this project at home. </p>
	    
	    
	    <p>After looking at some of the previous students project pages it seems that that Creative Commons is the most popular way to go. I like the many options and chose one that fit my view on sharing of work. I chose to make mine adaptable and sharable. In the future if I were to make a business venture out of this I would be more selling the plans to build the hotbox not sell actual assembled hotboxes.

        <p>Once I answered all of the basic questions and filled in my information I was given a link to place the Creative Commons logo on my site. This will allow all visitors and people doing research how to attribute work and what protections I have asked for.</p>
